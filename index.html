        <p>
            I’m a Computational Biologist who has a passion for understanding 'whys' and 'hows' behind the problems.</br></br>
            I have used large-scale biological datasets to answer questions related to how different organisms are </br> 
            related to each other across evolutionary time. I enjoy working on the problems to gain meaningful insights </br>
            but my inner motivation is about how it translates into the bigger picture.</br></br>
            I have an exquisite attention to detail, and my focus and decisive nature drive excellence for data analysis </br>
            organizing and identifying trends in large data sets to deliver high-quality outcomes.</br></br>
            During my Ph.D., I successfully managed multiple collaborative projects resulting in securing $100k in grant </br>
            funding and 2 publications.</br></br>
            As a Ph.D. student, I worked as a teaching assistant for various courses (Genetics, Animal Physiology, and </br>
            Introductory Biology), which helped me in communicating complex information to all kinds of audiences in an </br>
            effective manner. I’m a confident and articulate communicator. I have presented my research through 4 talks </br>
            and 2 posters in international symposiums and conferences.</br></br>
